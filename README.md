# Frontend Mentor - Product List with Cart Solution

This is my solution to the [Product List with Cart challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-list-with-cart-5MmqLVAp_d). It simulates an e-commerce cart experience, allowing users to add, remove, and manage items in a visually responsive interface.
